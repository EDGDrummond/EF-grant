# EF-grant
Code created as part of a grant with the EF's PSE team. Tasks include benching and comparing Halo2 & Groth16 (circom) on circuits of the same sizes with gadgets such as a range gadget. Also wrote a mini Halo2 explainer book for new devs (will continue to add to this), and will write a ressearch post at the end

I should note here that a lot of the starting code is taken directly from EF's halo2_proofs repo's example files
