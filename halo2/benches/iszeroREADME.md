In order to conduct an `iszero(in)` (wheere the output `out` is 1 if true and 0 otherwise), we need to satisfy 2 constraints:
- First define `inv` as the inverse of `in`
1. `1 - (inv * in) = out`
2. `in * out = 0`

To account for the negative sign we instead use `inv_neg` such that `in * inv_neg = -1`, converting the first constraint to
1. `1 + (ing_neg * in)`

These 2 constriants are defined by 3 gates. The second constraint is one gate and the first is split into:
a. `in * inv_neg = int`
b. `1 + int = out`


Run the command:

`cargo criterion --bench iszero`
